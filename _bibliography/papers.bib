    abstract = {In this paper we study the effects of IMF program participation and associated policy conditions, known as ‘conditionalities,’ on food self-sufficiency of IMF members for the period of 1980-2019. In the empirical analysis, we employ a compound instrumental variable  approach within a system of three equations, estimated using maximum likelihood. After accounting for confounding economic and climatic  factors and addressing selection bias, we find no robust evidence that IMF program participation has any effect on food self-sufficiency. In contrast, program conditions have a significant effect on food  self sufficiency. Based on point estimates, we find that each additional binding IMF condition reduces the cereal self-sufficiency ratio  by 0.003 percentage points. Disaggregating conditions by policy area, the findings suggest that IMF conditionality  hinders food self-sufficiency, with policy reforms in trade and exchange systems, financial sectors, monetary policy, and central banking playing a particularly significant role.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the empirical link between environmental policy and trade flows by incorporating global value chain in the analysis. To do so, I use CO2 embodied in domestic final demand as an indicator of the pollution content of imports (PCI), which is corrected for trade in value-added flows. I begin with investigation of North-South patterns, in particular if the PCI is relatively larger in Northern countries. Then, I carry out analysis of the determinants of PCI using a gravity-based empirical framework to quantitatively measure the impact of Pollution Haven (PH) and Factor endowment(FE) effects. Using several proxies for policy stringency, I show that PCI is higher for the North countries, which have more stringent regulations.  PH effect is found to be larger than what previous studies find, while FE has the opposite effect on PCI of the North. The former dominates the latter, together confirming the pollution haven hypothesis}
