	abstract = {In this paper we study the effects of IMF program participation and associated policy conditions, known as ‘conditionalities,’ on
food self-sufficiency of IMF members for the period of 1980-2019. In the empirical analysis, we employ a compound instrumental variable 
approach within a system of three equations, estimated using maximum likelihood. After accounting for confounding economic and climatic 
factors and addressing selection bias, we find no robust evidence that
IMF program participation has any effect on food self-sufficiency. In contrast, program conditions have a significant effect on food 
self sufficiency. Based on point estimates, we find that each additional binding IMF condition reduces the cereal self-sufficiency ratio 
by 0.003 percentage points. Disaggregating conditions by policy area, the findings suggest that IMF conditionality 
hinders food self-sufficiency, with policy reforms in trade and exchange systems, financial sectors, monetary policy, and central
banking playing a particularly significant role.},
