    abstract = {In this paper we study the effects of IMF program participation and associated policy conditions, known as ‘conditionalities,’ on food self-sufficiency of IMF members for the period of 1980-2019. In the empirical analysis, we employ a compound instrumental variable  approach within a system of three equations, estimated using maximum likelihood. After accounting for confounding economic and climatic  factors and addressing selection bias, we find no robust evidence that IMF program participation has any effect on food self-sufficiency. In contrast, program conditions have a significant effect on food  self sufficiency. Based on point estimates, we find that each additional binding IMF condition reduces the cereal self-sufficiency ratio  by 0.003 percentage points. Disaggregating conditions by policy area, the findings suggest that IMF conditionality  hinders food self-sufficiency, with policy reforms in trade and exchange systems, financial sectors, monetary policy, and central banking playing a particularly significant role.},
